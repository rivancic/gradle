### Examples

Public GitHub examples using binary Gradle plugins:

| Project  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **<a href="https://github.com/gradle-dependency-analyze/gradle-dependency-analyze" target="_blank">gradle-dependency-analyze</a>** | This is really practical binary Gradle plugin for spotting unused dependencies and can be perfect match for writing clean gradle scripts. Uses <a href="https://github.com/gradle-dependency-analyze/gradle-dependency-analyze/blob/master/build.gradle#L3" target="_blank">java-gradle-plugin</a> for developing a plugin, while the source code is written in Groovy. Definition of <a href="https://github.com/gradle-dependency-analyze/gradle-dependency-analyze/blob/master/build.gradle#L33" target="_blank">plugin ID and implementation class</a>. Main <a href="https://github.com/gradle-dependency-analyze/gradle-dependency-analyze/blob/master/src/main/groovy/ca/cutterslade/gradle/analyze/AnalyzeDependenciesPlugin.groovy#L14" target="_blank">AnalyzeDependenciesPlugin Plugin class. |
| **<a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin" target="_blank">micronaut-gradle-plugin</a>** | Binary plugin for development of Micronaut applications. There are <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle#L28" target="_blank">multiple plugins</a> packed into one artifact. All plugins extend simple <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/io/micronaut/gradle/MicronautBasePlugin.java" target="_blank">MicronautBasePlugin</a>, its whole purpose is to apply Micronaut Plugin specific extension. Other plugins then don't extend this plugin but they apply it themselves in the <a href="https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/io/micronaut/gradle/MicronautComponentPlugin.java#L74" target="_blank">apply() method<a>. Source code for the plugin is written in Java. |
